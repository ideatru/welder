## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by our code of conduct. Please treat all community members with respect and create a welcoming environment for everyone.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.24.0 or later
- Git
- Make (optional, for convenience commands)

### Development Setup

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/welder.git
   cd welder
   ```

3. **Add the upstream remote**:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/ideatru/welder.git
   ```

4. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   go mod download
   ```

5. **Verify the setup** by running tests:
   ```bash
   go test ./...
   ```

## Contributing Guidelines

### Types of Contributions

We welcome various types of contributions:

- **Bug Reports**: Help us identify and fix issues
- **Feature Requests**: Suggest new functionality
- **Code Contributions**: Fix bugs, implement features, or improve performance
- **Documentation**: Improve existing docs or add new documentation
- **Examples**: Add usage examples or tutorials

### Before You Start

1. **Check existing issues** to avoid duplicate work
2. **Create an issue** for significant changes to discuss the approach
3. **Keep changes focused** - one pull request per feature/fix
4. **Follow the coding standards** outlined below

### Coding Standards

#### Go Code Style

- Follow standard Go formatting (`gofmt`)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for exported functions and complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use Go modules for dependency management

#### Code Organization

```
welder/
â”œâ”€â”€ ether/          # Ethereum-specific implementations
â”œâ”€â”€ types/          # Core type definitions
â”œâ”€â”€ internal/       # Internal utilities (not exported)
â”œâ”€â”€ examples/       # Usage examples
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/           # Documentation and assets
â””â”€â”€ *.go           # Main library files
```

#### Naming Conventions

- **Packages**: lowercase, single word when possible
- **Functions**: CamelCase for exported, camelCase for unexported
- **Variables**: camelCase
- **Constants**: CamelCase for exported, camelCase for unexported
- **Types**: CamelCase for exported, camelCase for unexported

#### Error Handling

- Always handle errors explicitly
- Use meaningful error messages
- Wrap errors with context when appropriate:
  ```go
  if err != nil {
      return fmt.Errorf("failed to serialize schema: %w", err)
  }
  ```

### Schema and Type Safety

When working with schemas and types:

- Ensure all new types support the full range of Ethereum ABI types
- Add comprehensive validation for input data
- Maintain backward compatibility when possible
- Document any breaking changes clearly

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
go test ./...

# Run tests with coverage
go test -cover ./...

# Run tests with race detection
go test -race ./...

# Run specific test
go test -run TestSpecificFunction ./package
```

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Include edge cases and error conditions
- Use table-driven tests for multiple scenarios:
  ```go
  func TestWeld(t *testing.T) {
      tests := []struct {
          name     string
          schema   types.Elements
          payload  []byte
          expected interface{}
          wantErr  bool
      }{
          // test cases
      }

      for _, tt := range tests {
          t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
              // test implementation
          })
      }
  }
  ```

### Test Coverage

- Aim for at least 80% test coverage for new code
- Critical paths should have 100% coverage
- Include integration tests for complete workflows

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Document all exported functions, types, and packages
- Use Go doc conventions:
  ```go
  // Serialize converts a Welder schema into Ethereum ABI arguments.
  // It validates the schema structure and returns an Arguments object
  // that can be used for encoding and decoding data.
  func Serialize(schema types.Elements) (*Arguments, error) {
      // implementation
  }
  ```

### README Updates

- Update README.md if you add new features
- Include usage examples for new functionality
- Keep the quick start guide current

### Examples

- Add examples in the `examples/` directory
- Include comments explaining the code
- Test all examples to ensure they work

## Submitting Contributions

### Pull Request Process

1. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following the guidelines above

3. **Test thoroughly**:
   ```bash
   go test ./...
   go vet ./...
   ```

4. **Commit with descriptive messages**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add support for nested array schemas

   - Implement nested array handling in schema serialization
   - Add validation for deeply nested structures
   - Include comprehensive tests for edge cases"
   ```

5. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Create a pull request** on GitHub

### Commit Message Format

Use conventional commits format:

- `feat:` for new features
- `fix:` for bug fixes
- `docs:` for documentation changes
- `test:` for adding or modifying tests
- `refactor:` for code refactoring
- `perf:` for performance improvements
- `chore:` for maintenance tasks
